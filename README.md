# uArmTurtle
I'm implimenting turtle graphics using the new uArm Swift Pro, with the laser head. It should be usable with non laser heads too.

Feel free to use this project. There aren't many dependencies. It requires python 3, pyqt5 (pip installable), and the official pyuf library for the uArm Swift.

More documentation coming soon!
